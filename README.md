# Serving a Dynamic HTML using GitHub Pages

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to publish a notebook in an HTML format, via GitHub Pages. 

## Project Breakdown

- Provide a link to the original notebook in a GitHub repository that you created for this page. The repository should include:
  - A requirements.txt file with all packages used (0.25 points)
  - A README.md file (0.5 points)
  - A .gitignore file (0.25 points)
  - Provide a link to the live HTML page (publicly available through GitHub Pages) (0.5 point).
  
- The HTML page should include the following components:
  - A functioning Plotly graph with code (1 point)
  - A Matplotlib graph (0.5 points)
  - A Markdown title and text (0.25 points)
  - A Markdown table (0.25 points)
  - A Markdown equation using LaTeX (0.5 points)
  - Colored Markdown text using HTML tags (0.5 points)
  - An image, with the file included in the repository (0.5 points)

## Project Code

The code used for this project involves various packages such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, plotly, and IPython. The main goal is to create a dynamic HTML page with the inclusion of Markdown texts, tables, equations, images, and graphs from Plotly and Matplotlib. The code also makes use of urllib to fetch an image from the internet.

You can find the full code in the repository.

## Live Demo

The HTML page created by this code is publicly available via [GitHub Pages](https://pabloguineab.github.io/miniproject_18_part1/).
